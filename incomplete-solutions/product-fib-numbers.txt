latest Q

try to test orig f1 and f2 before recalc... then increment?

to ensure they're not > prod?

=====

orig

// find some way to split the prod so for starts higher (don't want to waste cycles at lower numbers when prod is 1000+)
// but must be 'below' the two we we are checking against

// start loop

// any way to know a fib number? or input it as an object or array to reference?

// take two fibs add to get third is 2nd and 3rd === prod? no is it > then return false
// else add to three for fourth and repeat

// use my fib algo from fCC


new Q have an array of numbers i have a number and want to find the one smaller than it, consider they are already sorted...

how do I do that without using an for loop?

refactoring the Q


// while loop.. while f1 * f2 < prod

// using this for first 100 fib number --> https://www.miniwebtool.com/list-of-fibonacci-numbers/?number=100
